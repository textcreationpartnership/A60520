            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE to the Reader. VVHERIN ARE SET dovvne the contents of this Treatiſe. 1.</head>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Roteſtants do teach,<note place="margin">See infra c. 2. n. 3 c. 12 n. 2.</note> that only the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal or capital points of Chriſtian faith, are of the ſubſtance of ſauing faith, true Church, and waie of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alone, truly and indeed,<note place="margin">Proteſtants make onely fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal points neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie.</note> neceſſarie to them: and that al other points of faith are, at moſt, of the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſauing faith, true Church, and waie of ſaluation, and maie be not beleued, though they bee ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed, without los of the ſubſtance of ſauing faith, true Church, or ſaluation. And in this ſenſe they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43717:3"/> call the principal points, <hi>Fundamental,</hi> that is, alone ſubſtantial and truly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſauing faith, to true Church, and to ſaluation: and call al other points, <hi>Not Fundamental,</hi> that is, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubſtantial, nor truly neceſſarie to ſauing faith, true Church, or ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, howſoeuer they be propoſed. And hereupon they teach, that al, who beleue the principal points of faith, howſoeuer they ſinfully beleue not other points, though they be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficienty propoſed to them, haue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith, are in the true Church, and in waie of ſaluation: and that who be deuided in ſecondarie points though ſufficiently propoſed, are not deuided in the ſubſtance of ſauing faith, of the true Church, or of the waie of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>2. And the cheif ground (though they pretend Scripture) of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin,<note place="margin">Their gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und therof.</note> that alone the principal points of faith are of the ſubſtance, and truly neceſſarie to ſauing faith, true Church, and ſaluation, is, that the principal points are termed <hi>Fundamental,</hi> or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43717:3"/> the foundation, by Fathers and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks: as if the wals and roof were not of the ſubſtance or neceſſarie to a howſe, becaus they are not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,<note place="margin">Their end.</note> or the foundation of it. But the end, for which they teach this doctrin, is, to mainteine by it, that ſuch perſons or Churches, as they cannot denie, but ſinfully err in ſome points of faith, ether ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them, or which would be ſo propoſed, if it were not their avoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fault, haue neuertheles a ſauing faith, are true Churches, and in waie of ſaluation, nor deuided from them in the ſubſtance of faith, of true Church, or way of ſaluation. So that mere neceſſitie of mainteining Churches ſinfully erring in ſome points of faith, drew them to this ſinful and pernitious doctrin, that the principal points of faith are wholy ſufficient, and al other points, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer propoſed, wholy vnneceſſarie to the ſubſtance of ſauing faith, true Church, and ſaluation. And this is in truth their doctrin concerning fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43717:4"/> and not fundamental points of faith, and their ground, and end of it. wherof the ground is ſillie, the end ſinful, and the doctrin pernitious and Antichriſtian, as quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing al Chriſtian faith, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after shal clearely appeare, and ſo abhominable, as the verie authors of it, are ashamed to exprès it in plaine termes, yea ſometimes forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it inwords.</p>
            <p>3. For albeit they teach expreſly and abſolutely, and without al excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or limitation of ſufficient or not ſufficient Propoſal of not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, that <hi>fundamentals,</hi> are ſufficient, and abundantly ſufficient, and <hi>Not fundamentals,</hi> are vnneceſſarie to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith, true Church, and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<note place="margin">They are aſhamed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uouch their doctrin.</note> yet they are ashamed to ſaie ſo expreſly with this addition, <hi>euen then when not fundamentals are ſufficiently propoſed,</hi> or, <hi>when it is the Vnbeleuers faults, that they are not ſo propoſed,</hi> or, <hi>when one ſinfully erreth, in not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals.</hi> Yea ſometimes they denie, they teach ſo, and affirme the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43717:4"/> Yet that in effect and in deed they teach ſo, and meane ſo, we wil<note place="margin">Yet are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to it.</note> proue out of their common Tenets and Principles, and their plaine words and deeds. Nether in truth would<note place="margin" type="runSum">1.</note> this diſtinction of <hi>fundamental</hi> and <hi>not fundamental</hi> points afford them anie colour of mainteining ſuch erring Churches, as they endeauour to mainteine by it, vnles they meant, that <hi>fundamentals,</hi> are ſufficient, and <hi>not fundamentals,</hi> vnneceſſarie, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith, true Church, and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euen when <hi>not fundamentals</hi> are ſufficiently propoſed; or, it is the Vnbeleuers fault, that they are not ſo propoſed, becaus it is euident, that ſuch Churches err in ſome points of faith, which, ether are ſufficiently propoſed to them, or would be, if it were not their fault, and ſo doe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully err in ſuch points. Nether alſo<note place="margin" type="runSum">2.</note> would there otherwiſe be anie contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie about the ſufficiencie of <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,</hi> and vnneceſſarines of <hi>Not fundamentals,</hi> to ſauing faith, true Church, and ſaluation, betwixt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43717:5"/> and Proteſtants: becaus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks grant, that <hi>fundamental</hi> points are ſufficient, and <hi>not fundamentals,</hi> vnneceſſarie (to be actually beleued) to ſauing faith, to a true Church, and to ſaluation, when <hi>not fundamentals</hi> nether are ſufficiently propoſed, nor it is the Vnbeleuers fault, that they are not ſo propoſed. Nether finally,<note place="margin" type="runSum">3.</note> would ſuch Churches, as they ſeek to mainteine by this diſtinction, giue them anie thanks, if they would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſauing faith, true Church, and ſaluation, only to ſuch of them, as inuincibly err in ſome not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points not ſufficiently propoſed to them, or which not for their fault are not ſo propoſed, and would denie ſauing faith, true Church, and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to al, that err ſinfully in anie point of faith: Wherfore as long, as by this diſtinction, they ſeek to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine erring Churches, or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with ſuch Churches, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting thos, who ſinfully err in not fundamental points, and alſo hold ſuch common Tenets and Principles
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43717:5"/> as they hold, in vaine they denie, that they teach that fundamental points are ſufficient, and not fundamentals not neceſſarie, to ſauing faith, true Church, and ſaluation, euen when not fundamentals are ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or would be, if it were not the vnbeleuers fault.</p>
            <p>4. And this their doctrin, that<note place="margin">Proteſtants cal their doctrin of defending ſinfully er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants in faith cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> ſuch, as beleue the fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal points, but ſinfully err in not fundamental points, or (which is al one) who err in not fundamental points ſufficiently propoſed to them, or which for their fault, are not ſo propoſed to them, haue ſauing faith, are in the true Church, and waie of ſaluation, they cal <hi>Charitie:</hi> and becaus we afford nether ſauing faith, true Church, nor ſaluation to anie ſuch, ſaie, they haue more charitie then we haue. But this their charitie towards ſinful errants in ſome points of ſaith, is not ſolid and<note place="margin">But it is fals chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ungrounded</note> grounded in anie word of God, which auoucheth ſuch ſinful errants to haue ſauing faith, to be in the true Church, and in waie of ſaluation, as ſo main a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43717:6"/> point ought to be: but is only apparent charitie, grounded in humane pittie or compaſſion, if not in flatterie of ſuch errants, and is directly oppoſit to the word of God (as shal hereafter appeare) and to true charitie, as damnably deceauing them, by telling them that they haue ſauing faith, who<note place="margin">The mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this doctrin.</note> deſtroie al ſauing faith; that they are in the true Church, who deſtroie the forme and vnitie of the true Church; and that they are in ſtate of ſaluation, who damnably ſin againſt faith; who excuſe al hereſies in not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points, from damnable ſin; who bring in libertiniſme to beleue or not beleue not fundamental points; who allow communion in Sacraments with al heretiks in not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal points; who denie Gods veracitie, and (as Proteſtants themſelues ſometimes<note place="margin">See c. 10, n. 5. 6.</note> confes) commit Infidelitie, and giue God the Lie. Such charitie it is (as God willing I shal clearely shew) to afford ſauing faith, true Church, and ſauation, to thos, who ſinfully err in not fundamental points: or (which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43717:6"/> is al one) who err in not fundamental points of faith ſufficiently propoſed, or when it is their fault, that they are not ſo propoſed. Wherfore this fals charitable doctrin, is to be deteſted and impugned, not as a ſimple he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie or error in faith, but as a ground<note place="margin">And a gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie, and Atheiſme.</note> of hereſies, ſciſme, infidelitie, and atheiſme. And it is in itſelfe ſo horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Chriſtian eares, as the verie defenders of it (though in verie deed and effect they do defend and muſt defend it, as long as they wil defend ſuch erring Churches, as they do, and communicate with them, and hold other their common Tenets and principles) yet are ashamed to auouch it in exprès words, yea in words ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſclaime from it.</p>
            <p>5. wherfore in this Treatiſe, firſt<note place="margin">VVhat is handled in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> of al, I ſet down plainely the true dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt Catholiks and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, toutching this diſtinction of Fundamental and not fundamental points of faith, in what ſenſe it is good, and admitted by Catholiks: in what, it is naught, and meant by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43717:7"/> Proteſtants. Next, I prove by Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants cleare words and deeds, and by diuers their common Tenets and Principles, that they hold, that vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and ſinful error in not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points, or error in them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently propoſed, maie ſtand with ſauing faith, true Church, and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After I shew, why Proteſtants make diſtinction of points of faith ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by thes Metaphorical and obſcure termes, <hi>Fundamental, not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> then by proper and cleare termes, <hi>Neceſſarie, not neceſſarie.</hi> Then, that Proteſtants are not certaine, what a <hi>not Fundamental</hi> point is, nor vhich be <hi>fundamental</hi> points, which not: nor whether a true Church can err in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points, or no, but now ſaie one thing, now the contrarie, as it maketh to their preſent purpos. Which evidently sheweth, that this their doctrin of the ſufficiencie of Fundamentals, and vnneceſſarienes of not fundamentals, is but a shift for the preſent, and not firmely beleved even of them who teach it: and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43717:7"/> do build vpon it, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe of perſons and Churches, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully erring in ſome points of faith, and of their own communion with ſuch, in Sacraments and publik wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God. Which is to build their own and other mens ſalvation vpon a ground, not only moſt fals, and which they are ashamed to avoutch in plaine termes, but alſo which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues dot not firmely beleue.</p>
            <p>6. And having shewed in the firſt booke this vncertaintie of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, touching their Fundamental and not fundamental points, in the ſecond, I proceed to certaineties. And firſt of al, becaus Proteſtants ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaie, that <hi>not Fundamental</hi> points ar not points of faith, I prove, that there are manie points of faith, beſide the Principal or Capital points, which are thos that are called <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</hi> Next I prove, that ſinfully to denie anie point of faith, or parte of Gods word what ſover, ſufficiently propoſed, is formal hereſie; then, that euerie hereſie, is da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable, and deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43717:8"/> ſalvation: alſo, that al ſuch ſinful denial, deſtroieth true ſaving faith, true Church, and their vnitie and alſo Gods veracitie and conſequently his Deitie. Moreouer, that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Sacraments or publik ſervice, with anie Church, that ſinfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth anie point of faith, is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. And al thes points I proue, by euident Teſtimonies of holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Fathers, and confirme them by reaſon, and confeſſion of Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. Which is the ſufficienteſt kinde of proof, that Proteſtants can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. After this, I shew that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction <hi>of Fundamental</hi> and <hi>Not-fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points</hi> in the Proteſtants ſenſe, hath no grownd in Scripture, Fathers, reaſon, or doctrin of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks, as ſome Proteſtants pretend: but that the whole grownd therof, is mere neceſſitie to have ſome colorable shift to defend by it, Churches vincibly and ſinfully erring in ſome points of faith. And alſo, that though this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction were admitted in their ſenſe, yet it would not ſuffice to defend
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43717:8"/> ſuch Churches, as Proteſtants endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to defend by it: becaus they are devided not only in not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, but alſo in fundamental points: and moſt manifeſtly and vndeniably, in Communion of Sacraments and publik worship of God. Which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, I prove by Scripture, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, reaſon, and confeſſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to be eſſential to a true Church, and what Churches are devided in this Communion, to be eſſentially deuided. And hence infer, that it is<note place="margin">VVhen er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in faith is ſinful.</note> not enough to a true Church, or member thereof, or to the way of ſalvation, that one beleue al the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points: But that it is alſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſarie, that he doe not ſinfully err in anie point of faith or in communion: and hee erreh ſinfully, who erreth, when the point of faith or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion is ſufficiently propoſed to him, or for his fault is not ſo propoſed to him. And that Luther and his followers, who devided themſelves<note place="margin">Chilling. c. 5. p. 273.</note> (as is evident alſo confeſſe by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants) from the whole viſible
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43717:9"/> Church, in communion of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and publik worship of God, devided themſelues eſſentially, and from the eſſence of the whole viſible<note place="margin">Luther in leauing the communion of the whole Church, leaft her ſubſtance.</note> Church. And ſo were in no viſible Church. at al (becaus the whole, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth al) or were in an eſſentially new made Church, as their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Sacraments and in their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blik ſervice amoung themſelves, was ſubſtantially new, and not before, ether among themſelues, or among anie other Chriſtians. For a new eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part of a Church, which was not before, muſt needs make a new eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Church, which was not before.</p>
            <p>7. And becaus Proteſtants hold<note place="margin">Protestants hold ſome part of the Churches faith, but no part of her communion.</note> manie of the points of faith, which they held before their ſeparation: but hold no part of the Communion in Sacraments and publik worship of God, which they held before with the viſible Church, but haue made a quite new Communion among themſelues, in Sacraments and publik ſeruice, which Communion, nether they, nor anie Chriſtians before
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43717:9"/> them, had: therfore they cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguish Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion into fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and not fundamental (as they do points of faith) nor can ſaie, they hold the fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal parte of their former Communion, and therby pretend, that they hold the ſubſtance of the ſame viſible Church, as they ſaie) they hold the fundamental part of the faith they had before, and by holding the fundamental parte of the faith of the viſible Church, pretend, they hold ſtil the ſame ſubſtance of the viſible Church. Wherupon our argument taken from their whole leauing the Communion of the whole viſible Church, in Sacraments and publik worship of God, (which is eſſential to the Church) is far more forcible to proue that they haue left the verie ſubſtance of the whole Church, and ſo are in no ſubſtantial Church, or in an other ſubſtantially new made, then that, which is taken from their leauing in parte, the faith of the whole viſible Church: though in truth both argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be forcible enough, as we shal

            <p>8. Laſtly; I propoſe to the Reader, a ſumm of the Proteſtants vncertainties or contradictions, touched in this Treatiſe, that therby he maie viſibly ſee, that they are not certaine, what to ſaie, but merely make vſe of what ſerueth them for the time: and ſo, that al they ſaie, is but shifts for a time. For whiles they are racked by the<note place="margin">Protestants confes truth whiles they are upon the rack.</note> euidence of truth, they confès, that al points of faith ſufficiently propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, are neceſſarie to a ſauing faith, to true Church, and to ſaluation: that ſinful denial of anie point of faith, is true hereſie, deſtroieth ſaluation, faith, Church, and vnitie thereof: That Communion in Sacraments and publik worship of God, is eſſential to the Church, and that for want therof, Sciſmatiks are out of the Church, and in ſtate of damnation. But when they look back vpon the Churches which they manteine, and ſee how they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully denie ſome points of faith ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed to them, or for their fault, haue them not ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them, and are deuided,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43717:12"/> partly in matters of faith, and wholy in Communion of Sacraments, and publik worship of God, they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to denie al that before they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, of ſauing faith, true Church, and true Communion. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this their inconſtancie, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they would ioine ſauing faith, with their faith, true Church, with their Church, true Communion, with their Communion. Which is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, as to ioine truth with lies, life with death, heauen with hel. And whoſoeuer ſeeketh to ioine ſuch toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt needs, be, as the Scripture ſpreaketh, <hi>vir duplex animo, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iacob. 1.</note> 
               <hi>eſt in omnibus viis ſuis.</hi> Wheras Catholiks (their faith, Church, and Communion, being true faith, true Church, true Communion) eaſily and without anie contradiction at al, ioine them together, and shew by the verie definitions of true faith, true Church, true communion, giuen by Scripture, and Fathers, confirmed by reaſon, and approued by Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants themſelues, that their faith,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43717:12"/> their, Church, their communion, is true. And if Proteſtants would with indifferencie conſider this quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie proceeding of Catholik and Proteſtant Writers, they would eaſily ſee, that they conſtantly defend truth, thes vnconſtantly make shifts for to to vphold vntruths for a time.

               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> 
               <hi>follie wil be made manifeſt to al.</hi> And as Saint Cyprian affirmeth: <hi>This is true</hi>

               <hi>madnes, not to think or know, that lies do not long deceaue.</hi> At length shifts wil appeare to be but shifts, and that which needeth them, to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.</p>
            <p>9. And finally, out of al which, I haue ſaied, I conclude, that it is no way againſt charitie, but rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to true Chriſtian faith and<note place="margin">Charitie, to warne ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful errants of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> charitie, to tel al Churches and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which err in anie point of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, or in communion in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, ſufficiently propoſed, or who ſinfully err againſt anie point of faith, or communion in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that whiles they doe ſo, they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43717:13"/> are in ſtate of damnation, that being ſo warned of their error, they may correct it, and auoid damnation: And at laſt is breifly shewed, that Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Churches ſinfully err, both in points of faith, and in communion of Sacraments.</p>

                  <note place="margin">which is a verbal que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</note> and others, <hi>not fundamental,</hi> is no great matter.

               </p>
               <p>3. And the end, why Proteſtants deuiſed this diſtinction of fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43717:22"/> and not fundamental points in their forſaid ſenſe or rather, wreſted this diſtinction vnto their foreſaid ſenſe, is, for to defend ſome Churches or perſons to haue ſauing faith, to be true Churches, and in waie of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who ſinfully err in ſome points of faith, ether becaus they wil not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue them though they be ſufficiently propoſed, or are in fault, that they are not ſo propoſed: For (as is ſáid) Not Fundamentals, in caſe of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient propoſal, are neceſſarie to ſauing faith, Church, and ſaluation. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Proteſtants take this diſtinction<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In what ſenſe Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, and not fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental.</hi>
                  </note> in a quite different ſenſe from Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks, and by <hi>fundamental points,</hi> mean ſuch, as (ſaie they) are not only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly neceſſarie, but alſo abſolutly ſufficient (to ſauing faith, Church, and ſaluation) to be beleued, euen when other points are ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and not beleued. And by <hi>Not fundamental points,</hi> mean ſuch, as are abſolutly Not neceſſarie to ſauing faith, Church, or ſaluation, to be actually beleued, euen when they are ſufficiently propoſed, or the Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleuers
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43717:23"/> are in fault, that they are not ſo propoſed. And that Proteſtants made or vnderſtand this diſtinction of <hi>fundamental</hi> and <hi>not fundamental</hi> in this ſenſe, for to defend therby ſuch as ſinfully err in ſome points of faith, is euident by itſelf, and by thes words of Rouſe in his Treatiſe of Cath. Charitie c. 9. <hi>This diſtinction was firſt framed, to giue leaue for difference in meaſure of faith.</hi> For this meaſure of<note place="margin">The points in queſtion, for funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals.</note> faith, he admitteth concerning points ſufficiently propoſed. Wherfore al the queſtion betwixt Catholiks and Proteſtants, about Fundamental and not fundamental points, is, Whether there be anie ſuch <hi>fundamental points,</hi> as the beleif of them, is ſufficient to ſauing faith, Church, and ſaluation, euen when ignorance or error in other points, is vincible and ſinful: or (which is al one) when other points are ſo ſufficiently propoſed, as points of faith need to be, or should be, if it were not the Not-beleuers fault, and yet are not beleued. And whether, there be anie ſuch <hi>Not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And for not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</note> points of faith, as the actual
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43717:23"/> beleif of them is not neceſſarie to ſauing faith, Church, or ſaluation, when they are ſufficiently propoſed, and virtual or intentional beleif of them be neceſſarie, whether they be propoſed, or no: or (which cometh al to one) whether, <hi>not fundamental</hi> points be ſuch, as vincible and ſinful ignorance or error in them, maie ſtand with ſaing ſauing faith, true Church, and ſaluation. For ſuch <hi>ſufficiencie</hi> of fundamental points, and ſuch vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarines of not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal points, to ſauing faith, true Church, and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Proteſtants affirme, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks vtterly condemn.</p>
               <p>4. Proteſtants cal this diſtinction<note place="margin">Protestants charitie.</note> in their ſenſe, <hi>Charitie,</hi> or (as Rouſe termeth it) <hi>Catholik Charitie,</hi> becaus it affordeth ſauing faith, true Church, and ſaluation, vniuerſally to al that beleue the Capital or principal points of faith, howſoeuer ſinfully they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue not other points. But firſt, this<note place="margin">But both vngrounded and fals.</note> Charitie is not grounded in anie Word of God, (but rather is quite contrarie to it, as shal hereafter appeare) but only in ſome humane pittie, or rather
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43717:24"/> fond flatterie of themſelues, and of others, who ſinfully err in ſome points of ſaith: and therfore is but ſeeming, and in truth, fals and deceiptful cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Secondly, it is quite oppoſite to true charitie, becaus it damnably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth thoſe, who ſinfully err in not fundamental or ſecondarie points of faith, telling them, that though they beleiue them not, when they are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently propoſed, or when it is their fault, that they are not ſo propoſed, yet they haue ſauing faith, are in the true Church, and in way of ſaluation: Which is in truth to deſtroie the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and vnitie of ſauing faith, of true Church, and of ſaluation; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe al hereſies in ſecondarie points of faith from mortal or damnable ſin: to bring an indifference or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſme in beleif or not beleif of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarie points of faith: to giue leaue to Sciſme, and to communion with heretiks; to reiect Gods veracitie in ſecondarie points of faith, and<note place="margin">See c. 8. n. 5. c. 10. n. 5. 6. L. Epiſt. to the King.</note> ſo to laie a ground of atheifme, and finally (as Proteſtants ſometimes, conuinced by euidencie of truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes)
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43717:24"/> is infidelitie, and the giuing of the Lie to God. Wherfore in vaine do ſome, who teach this doctrin, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, that <hi>Atheiſme and irreligion getteth ſtrength,</hi> ſeing that to teach that ſome points of faith are ſufficient to ſauing faith, true Church, or ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and others, not neceſſarie, though thes be ſufficiently propoſed, or it be the not beleuers fault, that they are not ſo propoſed, is plaine Atheiſme and Irreligion. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as I ſaid in the Preface) this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin is not to be deteſted and impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a ſingle, or ſimple error in faith, but as a ground of al hereſies in ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie points of faith, of Sciſme, of Infidelitie, and Atheiſme. For as long as they mainteine ſuch to be true Churches, to haue ſauing faith, and to be in the waie of ſaluation, which ſinfully err in ſome points of faith, or (which comes al to one) which beleue not ſome points of faith ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently propoſed to them, or for their fault not ſo propoſed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or communicate in Sacraments and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blik Liturgie with ſuch Churches,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43717:25"/> in vaine they denie, that they hold this doctrin. For their ſaid mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or communion with ſuch Churches, is a real profeſſion of this doctrin, and wil force them to confes, that they hold it. But now let vs prove that Proteſtants both by words and deeds teach this doctrin, becaus they ſometimes (conſidering the horror of it) do denie, that they teach it. But this their Denial wil prove no more, then that they contradict themſelues, as is vſual for hereticks to doe, and that the doctrin is ſo horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as themſelues ſometimes are ashamed of it.</p>
               <p>I enquire not here, who is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient<note place="margin">what is not here enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> Propoſer of points of faith, to wit whether Sripture or Church, or both: nor, which is a ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of points of faith: nor, what points of faith are ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Neverthles manie and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<note place="margin">what is here proued.</note> points are here handled: For firſt is confuted that moſt fals and Atheiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical<note place="margin" type="runSum">1.</note> doctrin, <hi>that the principal or fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points of faith are abſolutly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43717:25"/> ſufficient to ſauing faith, to a member of the true Church, and to ſaluation:</hi> So as if one beleve that, hee need not care (for ſo much as is to haue ſaving faith, to be a member of the true Church, and in waie of ſalvation) whether he beleve anie other points or no. Becaus (as is here proued) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they ſufficient to ſaving faith, in caſe that the les principal, or not fundamental points be ſufficiently propoſed, or would be ſo propoſed if it were not the Vnbelevers fault, and are not beleved: Nether though they were ſufficient even in that caſe to ſaving faith, were they ſufficient to a member of the true Church or to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Becaus Communion in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and publik worship of God, is as neceſſarie to a member of the true Church, and to ſalvation, as faith<note place="margin" type="runSum">2.</note> is. Secondly, is here confuted the like fals and Atheiſtical doctrin: <hi>That the les principal or not Fundamental points of faith are abſolutly vnneceſſarie to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith, to a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the true Church, and to ſaluation, euen in caſe they be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43717:26"/> propoſed, or would be ſo propoſed, if it were not the Vnbeleuers auoidable fault:</hi> For it is here shewed, that the beleif of anie point of faith whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, ſufficiently propoſed, is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to ſauing faith, to a member of the true Church, and to ſaluation. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin" type="runSum">3.</note> here is confuted that like fals and Atheiſtical doctrin: <hi>That al who beleue the principal fundamental points of faith, are of the true Church: and that a true Church, and a Church beleuing al the fundamental points, is al one.</hi> For who beleue not a les principal, or not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental point of faith ſufficiently propoſed to them, or which would be ſo propoſed to them, if it were not their auoidable fault, are true here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks, and ſuch Churches, true hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Churches, and giue God the lie in thos points, though they beleue the principal, or fundamental points. Fourthly it is shewed to be a vaine proof: <hi>That one is of the ſame Church</hi>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">4.</note> 
                  <hi>with the Roman, becaus he beleueth al the Fundamental points of faith which the Roman Church beleueth.</hi> Becaus vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43717:26"/> beleif of al points of faith what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, and actual beleif of al points ſufficiently propoſed, and alſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in Sacraments and publik worship of God, is neceſſarie to be of the ſame Church with the Roman. Fiftly is shewed, that ſauing faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not<note place="margin" type="runSum">5.</note> ſtand with ſin in matter of faith. Sixtly is shewed, that it is not only<note place="margin" type="runSum">6.</note> the greatnes of the matters in points of faith, which bindeth vs to beleve it, but eſpecially the authoritie of the Reuealer: which beeing equal in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and leſſer points, equally bindeth vs to beleve them al when they are propoſed. Seventhly is shewed (though breifly and by the way) that<note place="margin" type="runSum">7.</note> Proteſtants generally ſpeaking, err ſinfully in not beleuing ſome points of faith: Becaus, beſids al other proofs, their own Miniſters confes that al their Churches err in ſome points of faith, and that they ſinfully err, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, becaus ether they haue had them ſufficiently propoſed to them, or might haue, if it were not their auoidable fault.</p>

True it is, that ſome times they ſaie, al diuine Reuelations ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly propoſed are neceſſarie, being forced therto by the euidencie of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43717:27"/> truth, and their confeſſions we shal<note place="margin">c. 3. n. 5. 67.</note> produce hereafter for confirmation of this truth: but true alſo it is, that often times they denie, that al ſuch truthes are neceſſarie to ſauing faith, true Church, and ſaluation, and they are forced to denie it, for to defend ſuch to be true Churches, to haue ſauing faith, and to be in the waie of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they cannot with anie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie denie, but that they beleue not, and reiect ſome diuine reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly propoſed to them, or which, (if it were not their fault) would be ſo propoſed. And their confeſſion of this truth ſometimes, doth not proue that other times they denie it not, but only, that they contradict themſelues herin; which is vſual for heretiks to doe.

Lord Canterburie ſec. 26. p. 196. ſpeaking of not fundamentals, ſaith abſolutely: <hi>In neceſſariis, in, or about things neceſſarie, there ought not to be contention to a ſeparation.</hi> And ſec. 28. p. 139. <hi>The whole Church cannot vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally err in abſolute fundamental doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trins, and therfore there can be no iuſt cauſe to make a ſciſme from the whole Church.</hi> So that if she ſinfully erred in not fundamentals ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, there were no iuſt cauſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.

               <p n="4">4. This ſame followeth evidently<note place="margin" type="runSum">4.</note> out of divers common tenets or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Proteſtants, as firſt: That al are of the Church, who hold the fundamental points, as is to be ſeen l. 1. of the Author of Proteſtancie c. 3. and 7. ſecondly, that puritie in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points, is a certaine note of a true Church ib. c. 7. Thirdly that to prove one to hold al the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43717:32"/> points (without proving, that he erreth not ſinfully in other points) is à ſufficient proof, that he is of the true Church. Fourthly, that we maie lawfully communicate with al, that hold <hi>not al things, but al things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie,</hi> as ſpeaketh Chillingworth c. 5.<note place="margin">Morton Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale l. 4. c. 2. Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with al, who fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally profes the faith of Chriſt.</note> p. 283. who p. 220. profeſſeth, that by <hi>Neceſſarie,</hi> he vnderſtandeth <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental.</hi> Fiftly, that only funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points are of the ſubſtance of ſauing faith, Church, and ſaluation. Sixtly, that they haue more charitie to erring Chriſtians, then Catholiks haue. For if al be of the Church, who hold the Foundation: If puritie in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, be a ſure Note of a true Church: If Holding the foundation, be a ſure proof, that one is of the true Church: If only fundamental points, be of the ſubſtance of ſauing faith, Church, and ſaluation: and that we maie lawfully communicate with al, that hold the foundation, euidently it followeth, that ſuch as hold the foundation, but ſinfully err in not fundamental points ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43717:33"/> are of the true Church. Beſids, if Proteſtants allow not ſauing faith, Church, and ſaluation, to ſuch, as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully err in not fundamentals ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed, they shew no more charitie to erring Chriſtians, then Catholiks doe. For we allow al to<note place="margin">Proteſtants haue no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re charitie then Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liks.</note> haue ſauing faith, to be in the Church, in waie of ſaluation (for ſo much as belongeth to faith) who hold the fundamental points, and inuincibly err in not fundamentals; becaus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are theſe ſufficiently propoſed to them, nor they in fault, that they are not ſo propoſed, as is euident, and<note place="margin">Cath. allow ſaluation to inuincibly errants in not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals.</note> confeſſed by Chillingworth c. 7. p. 139. and 400. If therfore they wil ſeem more charitable, then we are, they muſt allow ſaluation to ſuch, as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully err in not fundamentals, ether ſufficiently propoſed to them, or for their fault, not ſo propoſed. For to ſuch, we nether allow ſauing faith<note place="margin">But not to vincibly er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants in them.</note> true Church, nor ſaluation. And as long as Proteſtants hold their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doctrins hitherto related, in vaine they denie, that they afford
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43717:33"/> ſauing faith, true Church, and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſuch, as ſinfully err in not fundamental points ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. But now let vs ſee, both their doctrin, and deeds, towards heretiks; Papiſts, and Lutherans, and other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Churches, which wil euidently conuince, that they afford ſauing faith, true Church, and ſaluation, to ſuch, as they account to err ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in not fundamental points of faith.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And to omit, that ſometimes<note place="margin" type="runSum">5.</note> they teach, that not fundamental points are no points of faith, as we shal ſee c. 5. Whence it wil euidently follow, that beleif of them, is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſauing faith, or true Church, though they be ſufficiently propoſed, they teach, partly, that obſtinat error in not fundamental points is no true hereſie; nor ſuch obſtinat errants, true heretiks: partly, that al hereſie is not damnable.

And ſec. 4. p. 127. <hi>Theſe errors of the Donatiſts</hi> (about Rebaptization) <hi>were not in them ſelues heretical.</hi> Yet were they in a point of faith ſufficiently propoſed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43717:34"/> to them. L. Canterb. ſec. 21. p. 141. <hi>If the Church err in the foundation she Becomes Heretical.</hi> Chillingworth c. 4. p. 209. <hi>There are no damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, but ſuch as are plainly repugnant to thes prime verities.</hi> And p. 215. <hi>There can be no damnable hereſie, vnles it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict ſome neceſſarie truth.</hi> And c. 5. p. 271. <hi>Hereſie we conceaue an obſtinat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of anie error againſt anie neceſſarie article of the Chriſtian faith.</hi> And by <hi>neceſſarie truth,</hi> or <hi>neceſſarie article,</hi> he profeſſeth to vnderſtand <hi>fundamental,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Here n. 2.</note> as is before shewed. So that, no error againſt anie point of faith, is hereſie, or at leaſt, not damnable hereſie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be againſt ſome fundamental point.

And the reaſon, why they are admitted with their errors, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they ſin not in them, or they are not ſufficiently propoſed to them, but becaus they are not fundamental er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Nether is it likelie, that Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans that liue in France among Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſts, should not haue their errors ſufficiently propoſed vnto them. (For this were to condemn the Caluiniſts of want, both of zele to their Religion, and alſo of charitie to their erring Brethren) or at the leaſt, they might haue their errors ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed to them, if it were not their fault.

Thirdly, this their diſtinction is the ground of their defenſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies<note place="margin">The ground of Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts defence in main points.</note> of greateſt moment, to wit; which are true Churches, and in which ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maie be had: and with which, men maie communicate lawfully. For, if we proue, that the Proteſtant Church in general (as it comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth both Lutherans and Caluiniſts) is no true Church, nor can afford ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: nor is ſuch, as men may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully communicate withal, becaus her members are ſinfully deuided in points of faith and Religion, one
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43717:52"/> from the other, they anſwer not, that they are not ſinfully deuided, but that their diuiſion is not in points funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, but only in not fundamental points: which diuiſion doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that vnitie of faith, or of Church,<note place="margin">D. Potter ſec. 2. p. 38.</note> which is neceſſarie. Likwiſe, if we proue, that the Lutherans are no true<note place="margin">L. Canterb ſec. 38. p. 325.</note> Church, becaus they are deuided in points of faith from the Caluiniſts, their anſwer is, this diuiſion is not in fundamental points, but only in points not fundamental, which diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (whether it be ſinful, or no) doth not deſtroie the ſubſtance of a true Church. The like anſwer for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, Proteſtants doe giue, when it pleaſeth them to grant, that she is a true Church, and that ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion maie be had in her. Finally, if we proue, that no particular Proteſtant Church can be a true Church, or haue hope of ſaluation, becaus (as Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants confes) euerie one of their Churches erreth in ſome point of faith, nay that there is no hope, that anie Church shal be free from al
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43717:52"/> error in points of faith, they anſwer: This error is only in not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points, which error deſtroieth not ſauing faith, Church, or meanes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, whether it be vincible and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or no.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thus we ſee, that by meanes of this diſtinction, of <hi>fundamental, and not fundamental</hi> points, Proteſtants doe make Churches to be true, or falſe, as they pleaſe, accordingly, as they make points of faith to be fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, or not fundamental, as they pleaſe: nether telling vs conſtantly, which are fundamental, which not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; nor giuing vs anie certaine rule to know which are ſuch, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing the determination hereof to their ends, as they need: Secondly by meanes of this diſtinction, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour<note place="margin">what kind of erring Churches maie be true Churches.</note> to mainteine three main points, to wit: That ſuch Churches, as they confes to err in ſome points of faith, are notwithſtanding true Churches: That ſaluation may be had in ſuch erring Churches: And that men may lawfully communicate with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43717:53"/> erring Churches. Which doctrin of theirs, if it were meant only of ſuch Churches, as inuincibly, vnwittingly or innocently err, or which err in <hi>not fundamental</hi> points, not ſufficiently propoſed, were not to be condemned: but being meant (as it is, and muſt be<note place="margin">what kinde of erring Churches Proteſtants meane.</note> by them, for manie ſuch Churches as they doe mainteine) of obſtinat or ſinful error, or of error about <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundamental</hi> points ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, is abhominable, and indeed the verie ground of atheiſme. Nether, though it were true, would itſuffice them for to mainteiue ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which they mainteine, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: both becaus they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times confes, that thoſe Churches do err euen in fundamental points: and alſo, becaus thoſe Churches want Communion in Sacraments, which is as eſſential, to a true Church, as faith is, as we shal shew hereafter.<note place="margin">C. 19.</note> So that this their ground of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining ſuch erring Churches as they doe mainteine, is not only fals and atheiſtical, but alſo though it were
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43717:53"/> true, were inſufficient to vphold ſuch Churches, as they endeauour to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold<note place="margin">Proteſtants ground, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true, nor ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for their purpoſe.</note> by it, as (God willing) I ſhal shew euidently in this Treatiſe.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="4">4. Thirdly, they teach, that <hi>not fundamentals points.</hi> are no points of faith. This followeth euidently out of what we euen now related: For if they be but opinions, obſcure, and doubtful matters, wherof we can haue no infallible certaintie, or aſſurance, not clearely defined in ſcripture, nor euidently deducible out of Scripture, they cannot ſaie, they are points of faith, vnles they wil turne faith into opinion, and make that a point of faith, which nether is clearely defined in Scripture, nor euidently deducible out of Scripture: But beſids this, ſome times they expreſly teach, that <hi>not fundamentals</hi> are no points of faith,<note place="margin">Not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals no points of faith.</note> or of Religion. Doctor Potter ſec. 2. p. 40. calleth not fundamental points, <hi>Things beſide, or without the faith.</hi> Sec. 5. p. 89. <hi>How Christ is in the Symbols, and how in heauen and earth, is no parte of faith.</hi> Sec. 6. p. 54. <hi>Our</hi> (Proteſtant) <hi>Controuerſies are none of them in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43717:57"/> ſubſtance of faith, but only in diſputable opinions.</hi> Lord Canterburie ſec. 39. p. 387. <hi>Superſtructures are doctrins about the faith, not the faith itſelfe, vnles they be immediat conſequences.</hi> And p. 388. <hi>Suppoſe vncertaintie in ſome of thes ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructures, it can neuer be thence conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that there is no infallible certaintie of the faith itſelf.</hi> p. 341. <hi>This Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Creed, and the Apostles, and no more, is the Catholik faith.</hi> Sec. 38. p. 361. he calleth <hi>Not fundamentals, opinions, which flutter about faith.</hi> And p. 376. ſaieth: <hi>Nor do the Church of Rome, and the Proteſtants, ſet vp a different Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For the Christian Religion, is the ſame to both.</hi> And yet theſe Churches<note place="margin">Not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tals make not differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in Religion.</note> differ, at leaſt, in not fundamental points, and ſo Not-fundamental points, are no points of Religion. Chillingworth c. 3. p. 129. <hi>But you</hi> (Papiſts) <hi>are al agreed, that only thoſe things, wherin you doe agree, are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Not matters of faith, in which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</note> 
                  <hi>of faith: And Proteſtants, if they were wiſe, would doe ſo too. Sure I am, they haue reaſon enough to doe ſo, ſeing al of them agree with explicit faith in al
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43717:57"/> thos things, which are plainly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly deliuered in Scripture.</hi> Thus Conſubſtantiation, vbiquitie, and ſuch, are not matters of faith. And in anſwer to the preface, when his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie had ſaied, <hi>That men of different Religions</hi> (as Papiſts and Proteſtants) <hi>maie be ſaued, is a ground of atheiſme,</hi> he wil not admit Papiſts and Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to be men of different Religions, but ſaieth p. 14. <hi>By men of different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, he muſt meane Chriſtians of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers opinions and communions, or els he</hi>

                  <hi>ſpeaketh not to the point.</hi> And c. 4. p. 209. <hi>The diuerſitie of opinions, which is among the ſeueral ſects of Chriſtians, ought to be no hinderance to their vnitie in communion.</hi> So that the ſeueral ſects of Chriſtians differ but in opinions, and yet doubtles they differ in not<note place="margin">Optatus l. 2. vbi vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, ibi eſt Eccleſia, &amp; non eſt vbi non vultis.</note> fundamentals. Lord Canterburie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſec. 39. p. 376. Potter ſec. 3. p. 58. White in Defenſ. of his way c. 38. and others ſay, that the Proteſtant and the Roman Religion are the ſame: and yet grant, that they differ in not fundamental points. Whence it muſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43717:58"/> needs follow, that not fundamental points are no points of Religion. For if they be points of Religion, who differ in them, differ in Religion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fourthly they teach, that no oppoſition to not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal points,<note place="margin">Error in not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals is not hereſie.</note> is true hereſie, as we shewed before c. 2. and it followeth out of what euen now we rehearſed. For if <hi>not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> points be no points of faith, oppoſition to them, cannot be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. For hereſie, is an error againſt faith. And as Lord Canterburie ſaieth ſec. 26. p. 198. <hi>Hereſie, properly cannot be, but in doctrin of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, Proteſtants not content to teach, that <hi>not fundamental</hi> points<note place="margin">Not funda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentals, are matters of nothing.</note> are but opinions, no points of faith, doubtful matters, and ſuch like, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeak contemptuouſly of them, as if they were not to be regarded at al: as when we obiect to Caluiniſts, their difference from Lutherans, in ſuch points, as they account not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals: Whitaker controu. 1. q. 4. c. 3. calleth them, <hi>ſmal matters.</hi> K.

And ſurely, If Not-funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points, were ſuch, as hitherto they haue deſcribed, euident it were, that euen obſtinat error in them could not deſtroie ſauing faith, true Church, or hope of ſaluation, nor hinder Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with anie Church obſtinatly erring in ſuch points.</p>

Some are fundamental not only by reaſon of their reuelation from God, and their ſufficient propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal to vs, but alſo of their owne nature, fundamental or neceſſarie to ſauing faith, Church, and ſaluation, as the paſſion of Chriſt, and ſuch like capital articles: others, not of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but merely becauſe they are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43717:68"/> reuealed from God, and ſufficiently propoſed to vs, are fundamental to faith, Church, and ſaluation, as that Saint Paul had a cloack &amp;c. And that when Proteſtants confes, that the Roman Church holdeth al the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, or erreth not in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, they meane of fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of the firſt kinde; when they ſaie she erreth in fundamentals, they meane of the latter kinde, and ſo do not contradict themſelues, becaus they do not affirme and denie the ſame kinde of fundamentals. True it is, that there is this difference bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weene points of faith, that ſome are fundamental to ſauing faith, to a true Church, and to ſaluation, both of their nature, and by reuelation ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed to vs, as the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Trinitie, the paſſion of Chriſt, and ſuch like: others are fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental or neceſſarie to ſauing faith, Church, and ſaluation, only by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Gods reuelation ſufficiently propoſed, as that Abraham had two Sonns, and ſuch like. But this wil
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43717:68"/> not ſuffice, to ſaue the aforeſaied Proteſtants from plaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction: becaus, (if not in wonds) in effect and ſenſe, they both affirme and denie that the Roman Church holdeth, and holdeth not, al points of faith that are fundamental of their nature. For whiles they ſaie, that she is a true Church in eſſence, a member of the Catholik Church and of Chriſt, that she holds the fundamental points which conſtitute a Church, which are the life and ſubſtance of Religion, the ſimply neceſſarie truths, by which ſome are ſaued, and that her ſubſtance and Religion is the ſame with the Proteſtants, they muſt needs meane, that she holdeth al the points, which of their nature are fundamental to ſauing faith, Church, and ſaluation: and contrariwiſe, whiles they ſaie, that the Roman Church holdeth errors of themſelues fundamental, hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted faith in the principal points, hath not the ſubſtance of preaching the word, is fallen into ſubſtantial corruptions, holdeth that, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Nether finally, doth this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between points of faith, iuſtifie theſe Churches, which they cannot denie, but ſinfully err in ſuch points, as they terme Not-fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points, For whenceſoeuer a point be fundamental to faith, Church, and ſaluation, whether of its nature, and reuelation too, or of reuelation only, they cannot ſtand without that, which is fundamental to them, as is euident by itſelef, and Proteſtants confes it, as we shal ſee beneath c. 7. n. 5.

               <p n="10">10. If anie Proteſtant anſwer, that though they be not certaine preciſely, which be fundamental articles, which not, yet they are certaine, that the Creed conteineth al fundamental ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which conſtitute a Church, and which in ordinarie courſe are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to be actually beleued: and this
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43717:71"/> is ſufficient to be certaine of: I replie, Firſt, that at leaſt they cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly certaine, that the Creed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth al ſuch fundamentals, becaus the Scripture (which they wil haue to teach al things, whereof we can be infallibly certaine) ſpeaketh not at al of the Creed, and conſequently they cannot be infallibly certaine, what Church, or perſons, beleue al, that is fundamental and neceſſarie to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualy beleued of euerie one, or who is in the waie of ſaluation, or with whom they maie lawfully communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43717:72"/> we beleue not al fundamental points. Lord Canterburie ſec. 33. p. 334. ſaieth. The fundamental points, <hi>are the Creed, and ſome deductions from it.</hi> Others ad other things, as is to be ſeene l. 1. de Authore Proteſtant c. 3. Secondly, they cannot ſaie, that the Creed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth al that is fundamental and neceſſarie to be beleued of euerie one. For iuſtification by only ſpecial faith, which is the moſt fundamental point of Proteſtancie, and the life, and ſoule therof, (as Proteſtants cal<note place="margin">See li. 11 de authore c. 6 throughout.</note> it) is nether actualy in the Creed, nor can be clearly deduced out of it. For to ſaie, that iuſtification by only ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial faith, is conteined in that article of the Creed; (<hi>Remiſsion of ſinns</hi>) is<note place="margin">One thing is the end, an other the meane ther-to.</note> abſurd. Becaus that article ſpeaketh only of the end, which is remiſſion of ſinns, not of the meanes to atteine vnto it, which Proteſtants wil haue to be only ſpecial faith, of which the Creed ſpeaketh not. And in the ſame manner, is Chillingworth refuted, when he ſaieth c. 3. p. 135. and 166. <hi>we are ſure, that al that is neceſſarie anie

               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the fift Chapter of the former boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke we shewed, how Proteſtants, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, (to wit, when they wil mainteine Churches erring ſinfully in <hi>Not-fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points,</hi> or ſaluation in them, their communion with them) affirme, that <hi>Not-fundamental points,</hi> are no

But firſt we wil shew, that there are true points of faith beſids thoſe, which are principal or capital; For this is the ground of al our diſcourſe following.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Firſt, whatſoeuer is clearely deliuered in Scripture, and ſufficiently propoſed to vs, is a matter of faith,<note place="margin">Manie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith in Scripture, beſid funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals.</note> and ought to be beleued: But there be manie things beſids the principal and capital articles, that are clearely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in Scripture, and ſufficiently propoſed to vs, as that Saint Paul had a cloak, Saint Timothe was ſicklie, and the like. Therfore they alſo are matters of faith, and ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondly, matters of faith are not<note place="margin">Matters of faith are to be meaſured by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal obiect of faith.</note> to be meaſured only by the greatnes of the material obiect, which is bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but eſpecially by the formal
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43717:79"/> obiect of faith, for which it beleues, which is diuine reuelation ſufficiently propoſed to vs. For euerie habit rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to whatſoeuer hath is formal obiect. But manie ſmal matters haue the like diuine reuelation ſufficiently propoſed, as that of S. Pauls clooke, and Timothes ſicknes; Therfore they are alike matters of faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the holie Scripture<note place="margin">In faith are both great and leſſer matters.</note> Mat. 5. and 22. ſaieth plainly, that there are greateſt and leaſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and that there are Iots or Tittles of the Law. And why not lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, great and les matters of beleif? If anie obiect, that though there be great and litle things commanded to be done, yet litle matters are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be done vnder paine of loſſe of Gods fauour, or of ſaluation: ſo though litle matters of ſaith be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, and ought to be beleued when they are ſufficiently propoſed, as teſtifyed by God; yet are we not bound to beleiue them vnder paine<note place="margin">Difference betwene matters to be done and to be beleued.</note> of damnation. I anſwer, that litle matters are not commanded to be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43717:80"/> done vnder paine of los of Gods freindship, or of ſaluation, becaus ſmal matters of their nature do not break freindship. For he were an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable freind, who for trifles would break freindship, and the end of the law is charitie: but al litle mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters teſtified by God, and ſufficiently propoſed to vs, oblidge vs to beleue them, becaus in not beleuing them,<note place="margin">differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt Faith and charitie touching ſmal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> we account God not worthie to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued in ſuch matters, which is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie his veracitie, and conſequently his deitie: For who in things equally teſtifyed by God, and equally propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">See Chillin. infra c. 4. n. 3. Potter ſec. 5. p. 3. The principal ground on which faith relies, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo p. 10.</note> to vs as from God, beleueth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, and not others, beleueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Gods authoritie, but becaus himſelf iudgeth ſomethings more liklie to be true, then others. For if he beleued anie for Gods authoritie, he would beleue al, which Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie equally propoſed, doth equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifie. Wherfore we maie keep charitie with God, though we obſerue not litle matters, commanded by him, becaus breach of litle maters, is not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43717:80"/> to charitie, but only to perfection of charitie. But we cannot keep faith with God, if we beleue not ſmal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, teſtified by him, and ſufficiently propoſed to vs, becaꝰ not beleif of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is oppoſit to Gods veracitie, which is the formal obiect of diuine faith, and implicitly ſaieth: God is not worthie of beleef in ſuch matters. For where is the leſt vntruth, there is not diuine or prime veracitie: ſo his veracitie is denied by the leſt vntruth, but not his charitie by the leſt ſin. Hereupon God in the laſt of the Apocalips, threatned to put him out of the book of life, who putteth out one word of that propheſie: but no where threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the like, to whoſoeuer shal not keep the leſt thing he commandeth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Holie Fathers alſo teſtifie, that al things reuealed by God, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed to vs, are matters of faith, in that (as we shal ſee he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter c. 2.) they account obſtinat error in al ſuch matters, to be formal hereſie, and al ſuch obſtinat errants, formal heretiks: And as Saint Baſil

               <p n="6">6. Proteſtants likewiſe ſometimes confes, and muſt needs confes, that al, that is clearely teſtified by God, and ſufficiently propoſed; or that thoſe points, which they cal vnfunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, if they be ſufficiently propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, are matters of faith, and of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

For this is to grant plainly, that no points of faith are ſo fundamental, as they are ſufficient to ſauing faith, Church, and ſaluation, if other points be ſufficiently propoſed and not bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43717:96"/> or for the not beleuers fault, not ſo propoſed: nor anie ſo not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, as they are not neceſſarie to ſauing faith, Church, and ſaluation to be beleued actually, if they be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently propoſed, and neceſſarie to be virtually beleued, whether they be ſo propoſed, or no. And al the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion betwixt Catholiks and Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants is, whether anie points of faith be thus fundamental, and anie thus Not-fundamental, or no. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus Proteſtants can not denie, but that ſome Churches, which they mainteine, haue had the truth, againſt which they err, ſufficiently propoſed to them, or if it were not their auoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fault, might and should ſee the truth, therfor when they are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend ſuch Churches, they forget this doctrin.

For thus Whitaker Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trou. 2. q. 5. c. 19. <hi>This place is ſurely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and thes words do shew, by what Notes the Apoſtolik Church was known and shewed. The firſt note, was the doctrin of the Apoſtles. For the Apoſtles deliuered that doctrin, which they receaued from Chriſt, the Chriſtians of thos times em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and perſeuered in it, and it diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished that companie of men from other companies and ſocieties. For they alone then were the true Church, who perſeuered in doctrin.</hi> And Pleſſie l. de Eccleſ. c. 2. <hi>Thes words of Scripture, are nothing but a deſcription of the true Church of Chriſt, inſtructed in the true faith of Christ by his word, and knit together in true loue by the Communion which is in him.</hi> But they who beleue only fundamental points, and ſinfully denie Not fundamental<note place="margin">The doctrin of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth al their doctrin.</note> points of faith, de not abſolutly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer in the doctrin of the Apoſtles. For <hi>the doctrin of the Apoſtles,</hi> is their

Who therfore perſeuer only in the fundamental points, and not in the vnfundamental, perſeuer only in a parte of the Apoſtles doctrin, and in parte leaue it, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently are not the true Church. Beſids, our Sauiour Ioan. 10. ſaieth: <hi>My sheep, heare my voice.</hi> But who heare his voice only in fundamental points, doe not abſolutly heare his voice, but in parte only, and in parte heare it not. For Chriſts voice, is as wel in Not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal points of his doctrin, as in fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental. Therfore ſuch are not Chriſts. And Ioan. 8. <hi>If ye abide in my word, ye shal be my diſciples indeed.</hi> But they abide not in his word, who forſake it in al points not fundamental. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, ſinful errors in faith, are gates of hel. But gats of hel preuaile not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſts true Church. Therfor not ſinful errors in faith. Beſids if the the Catholik Church, should ſinfully err in anie point of faith, she should not be holie men, nor a holie ſocietie.

               <p n="3">3. And in like manner, the holie Fathers define the true Church, as is euident by their excluſion of al he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks, and by this confeſſion of Moulins lib. 1. contra Peron cap. 2. <hi>The ancient Doctors are wont to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi>

Therfore if we wil vnderſtand by the <hi>Church,</hi> what the Fathers did, we cannot ſaie, that ſuch are of the Church. And this is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, becaus the true Church, which we beleue, is Catholik, as is profeſſed in the Apoſtles Creed: And <hi>Catholik,</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:43717:110"/> by the Fathers iudgment, erreth not in anie point of faith. For thus Saint Auguſt in l. imperfec. in Geneſin c. 1.<note place="margin">Catholik holdeth al.</note> 
                  <hi>The Church is called Catholik, becaus she is vniuerſally perfect, and halteth in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> And Epiſtle 48. <hi>Perhaps she is called Catholik, becaus she truly holdeth the whole, of which truth, ſome peeces are found in diuers hereſies.</hi> The like hath Saint Cyril. Catecheſi 18. S. Optatus l. 1. Patianus Epiſt. 1. Vincet. c. 3. But who denie anie point of faith ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed, are not vniuerſally perfect, nor truly hold the whole, but halt in ſomething. Therfore they are not Catholiks, and conſequently not of the true Church. Hooker l. 5. p. 324. <hi>Cyprian with the greatest part of African Bishops were of nothing more certainly perſuaded, then that heretiks are, as rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten branches, cut of from the life and bodie of the true Church.</hi>

               <p n="8">8. And this argument is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by what before we shewed, that the faith or doctrin of Chriſt, is an indiuiſible Copulatiue: And therfore al the points of it muſt be profeſſed, or it is not profeſſed. For an indiuiſible, muſt be al had, or none. And who profeſſeth only ſome parte of Chriſts doctrin, doth not profès the doctrin of Chriſt, but ſome parte, and no parte is the whole. And as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fès but ſome parte of his doctrin, and not the whole, ſo they are but in parte Chriſtians, and indeed not Chriſtians. For a whole or entire Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth Chriſts doctrin wholy and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely: and who profeſſeth it but in parte, and in parte reiecteth it, (as do
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:43717:122"/> they, who reiect anie point of his<note place="margin">Heretiks but in part, Chriſtians.</note> doctrin fufficiently propoſed) is but in parte a Chriſtian, and indeed no Chriſtian. And hence it is, that holie Fathers ſaie that heretiks are no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as indeed they are not, if by Chriſtians, we meane, not men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened, but followers of Chriſts doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin. For they follow not Chriſts doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin,<note place="margin">what Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches differ in profeſsion of faith, differ eſſentially.</note> but only ſome parte of it, and reiect the reſt. Moreouer, Churches voluntarily differing in profeſſion of Chriſts faith or doctrin, differ in the eſſence of the Church, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently eſſentially. For profeſſion of Chriſts faith or doctrin, is of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Church, and as ſuch, is put of al men in the definition therof. But Churches, wherof one profeſſeth al points of Chriſts doctrin, funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and Not fundamental, and the other, profeſſeth only funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, and ſinfully reiecteth Not fundamentals (though they be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed) differ in profeſſion of Chriſts doctrin. For his doctrin includeth as wel Not fundamentals,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:43717:122"/> as fundamentals: they being equally reuealed by him, and equally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to vs, as I ſuppoſe. Therfore the one of thes, is no true Church. For Chriſt hath not two Churches eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially differing.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Moreouer of two points<note place="margin">Chillingw. c. 3. p. 138.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:43717:128"/> nether for Chriſts authoritie, but for ſome other motiue humane. Againe, not to beleue Chriſts authoritie ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed, to be a ſufficient and iuſt Motiue to beleiue euerie thing taught by him, is to denie his vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie: But they who beleue not euerie thing taught by him, and ſufficiently propoſed to them as from him, do ſo.<note place="margin">Tertul. l. de carne Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti, vt quid dimidiatis mendatio Chriſtum, totus veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas eſt.</note> Therfore they denie his veracitie. The Maior is euident: the Minor I proue: For not to beleue euerie thing that Chriſt taught, and is ſufficiently proued to haue been taught by Chriſt, is implicitly to denie his authoritie ſufficiently propoſed, to be a ſufficient and iuſt motiue to beleue whatſoeuer he taught. And ſurely to denie Chriſts authoritie ſufficiently propoſed, to be a iuſt and ſufficient motiue to beleue, is to denie his veracitie to be ſufficient for beleif.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereupon rightly ſaid S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin to the Manichees: <hi>You who in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Z. 17. cont. Fauſt. c. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Scriptures beleue what you liſt, and what you liſt not, beleue not Scriptures, but yourſelues.</hi> And ſo I ſaie, who in points
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:43717:128"/> of Chriſts doctrin, equally taught by him; and equally propoſed to them, beleue what ſeemes true to them, and what ſeemes not true to them, beleue not, beleue not Chriſt, but themſelues. For if they beleued ether for Chriſts authoritie, they would equally beleue both, becaus his authoritie is equal to both. But becaus the motiue of their beleif, is ſeeming truth, and ſeeming truth is to them more in one, then in the other, they beleue the one, and not the other. And to this purpos Chillingworth in Anſwer to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face p. 23. ſaid. <hi>He that doth not beleue al the vndoubted parts of the vndoubted books of Scripture, can hardly beleue anie: nether haue we reaſon to beleue he doth.</hi> And he might haue ſaid ſo of al points of Chriſts doctrin ſufficiently propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that who beleueth not them al, beleueth none, to wit, with diuine faith and for Chriſts authoritie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus this is equal in al ſuch points, and therfore if it effectually work diuine faith for one point, it wil work the ſame for al. Wherfore thus I argue.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:43717:129"/> Where is equally the total cauſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine beleif, there is equally diuine beleif. In al points of Chriſts doctrin equally taught of him, and equally propoſed to vs, equally is the total cauſe of diuine beleif. Therfore in them al is equally diuine beleif, The Maior is euident. The Minor is cleare. For the total motiue cauſe of diuine beleif, is Chriſts authoritie, and that is equally in al points of his doctrin, which haue been equally taught by him, and are equally propoſed to vs, whether they be principal points, or ſecondarie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Finally, what it oppoſit to faith, is Infidelitie. Denial of anie point of faith ſufficiently propoſed is oppoſit to faith. Therfore it is infidelitie The Maior is euident, and the Minor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued l. 2. c. 4. But infidelitie denieth Chriſts veracitie, ether directly, as in thos, who profès not to beleue in Chriſt: or indirectly, as in thos, who beleue not what he clearely taught, and is ſufficiently propoſed to them for his doctrin. Beſids, he that denieth
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:43717:129"/> ſome or al the fundamental points of Chriſts doctrin ſufficiently propoſed to him, denieth Chriſts veracitie, and hath not ſauing faith. And why not he alſo, who denieth ſome or al Not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points of his doctrin ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed? ſeeing Chriſts au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie as equally teſtifieth thes, as thos. Why is not his authoritie equally denied in al points, which he equally teſtifieth? What doth the greatnes of the matter, ad to the greatnes of Chriſts authoritie? or what doth the ſmallnes of the matter, diminish of his authoritie? ſeeing it is not the greatnes of the matter, for which we ought to beleue it, but merely Chriſts authoritie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This alſo is confirmed out of what we related, out of the holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that al, who denie anie point of Chriſts faith ſufficiently propoſed, are heretiks: and that al heretiks, are no Chriſtians, haue no faith, but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels. For ſurely, whoſoeuer are no Chriſtians, haue no faith, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, doe in effect and (at the leaſt)
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:43717:130"/> implicitly and indirectly denie Chriſts veracitie. And Proteſtants add here to (as we shewed before c. 4.) that Heretiks are Apoſtates, AntiChriſts, and Diuels: and ſurely ſuch) at leaſt in effect and indirectly) denie Chriſts veracitie. Moreouer S. Auguſtin (as we rehearſed before) affirmeth, that Chriſt is in name only with anie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks. And ſo heretiks profès Chriſt in name only, and in effect denie his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racitie.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And this truth is ſo manifeſt, as Proteſtants ſometimes confès it. For thus Doctor Potter ſec. 7. p. 74. <hi>It is true, whatſoeuer is reuealed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:43717:130"/> becaus faith cannot be without al that, which is fundamental to it: And alſo, that it is infidelitie to denie anie ſuch thing, and infidelitie denieth diuine veracitie. Chillingworth alſo in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Preface p. 11. <hi>For a man to denie or disbeleue anie point of faith ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently preſented to his vnderſtanding, as a truth reuealed by God, is to giue God</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And to giue God the lie.</note> 
                  <hi>the lie.</hi> And to giue God the lie, ſurely is to denie his veracitie. By which is refuted what he ſaith c. 3. p. 135 <hi>without anie the leſt dishonor to Gods vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, I maie doubt of, or denie ſome truth reuealed by him, If I nether know, nor beleue it to be reuealed by him.</hi> And p. 136. <hi>He only, in fact affirmes, that God doth deceaue or is deceaued, who denies ſome things, which himſelf knowes or beleues to be reuealed by God.</hi> which he oftentimes repeateth. For if to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie or disbeleue anie point of faith ſufficiently preſented to his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as a truth reuealed by God, be to giue God the lie, he dishonoreth Gods veracitie, and in effect affirmes that he doth deceaue, or is deceaued,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:43717:131"/> who denieth or disbeleueth a point of faith ſufficiently preſented in his vnderſtanding, as a truth reuealed by God, though he nether know, nor beleue it to be reuealed by God. For merely to denie or disbeleue a point of faith ſufficiently preſented to his vnderſtanding, is (as he ſaid truly) to giue God the lie, whether he know or beleue it to be reuealed by God, or no. And otherwiſe affected ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that God hath reuealed a point, which is ſufficiently preſented or propoſed to our vnderſtanding as reuealed by God, should be no dishonour to Gods veracitie, nor a giuing the lie in effect to him. And hence it is euident, that albeit onely the principal points of Gods reuealed word be ſo in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant betweene him and men, as it is neceſſarie in al ordinarie courſe to be actually beleued of al, that can ſo beleue: yet Gods whole reuealed word is ſo included in the ſame coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as it is alſo neceſſarie to be bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at leaſt virtually, becaus who doth nether actually nor virtually beleue
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:43717:131"/> his whole reuealed word, doth not beleue him to be the prime veritie, or true in al his words: And ſurely they doe nether actually nor virtually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue al Gods reuealed word, who wil not beleue ſome parte of it, when it is ſufficiently propoſed to them for Gods word.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And out of al that hitherto I haue ſaid, it appeareth (I hope) ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, that to teach, that ſome points of Chriſtian ſaith are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to ſauing faith, to a member of Chriſts Church, and to ſaluation; to be actually beleued, when they are ſufficiently propoſed, and virtually and in purpoſe of minde, whether they be propoſed or no, is damnably to deceaue ſoules, is to excuſe manie damnable hereſies from damnable ſin, is to introduce an indifference or libertiniſme in Chriſtian Religion, for beleuing or not beleuing the moſt points of Chriſtian faith, is to deſtroie the verie ſubſtance and vnitie of Chriſtian faith, is to deſtroie the ſubſtance and vnitie of Chriſts
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:43717:132"/> Church, and to deſtroie Gods vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, to introduce infidelitie, the giuing of the lie to God, and atheiſme.

               <p>His ground out of Scripture, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus, ſaieth he, ſec. 7. p. 76. <hi>The dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ground of the Church, are thos grand and capital doctrines, which make vp our faith in Chriſt, that is, that common faith Tit. 1. 4. which is alike pretious in al 2.

               <p>3. Moreouer, how can you think it certaine, that Saint Paul here by <hi>ſuperſtructions,</hi> meaneth anie doctrin at al, ſeing Saint Auguſtin de fide c. 16. Enchir. c. 68. and Enarrat. in Pſal. 38. 80. and S. Gregorie l. 4. Dialog. c. 39. expound it only of works, nor you conuince the contrarie? Finally, admit, that by <hi>ſuperſtructions</hi> S.

Admit alſo, that by <hi>ſuperſtructures,</hi> he meaneth ſome points of faith, how proueth D. P. that S. Paul meaneth, they are not
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:43717:141"/> neceſſarie to ſauing faith, Church, or ſaluation, when they are ſufficiently propoſed, ſeing he nether ſpeaketh of ſufficient propoſal, nor ſaieth, that ſuch ſuperſtructures are not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, not yet calleth them ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in reſpect of faith, or Church, but in reſpect of the foundation, as walls and roofe may be called ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructures in reſpect of the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and yet are neceſſarie parts of the houſe. And ſo ſecondarie points of faith may be called ſuperſtructures in reſpect of the principal points, on which they relie as vpon their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and yet be neceſſarie parts of the ſpiritual building of faith and Church.</p>
               <p>4. So that this ſuperſtruction of<note place="margin">Proteſtants not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals want foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</note> D. Potter wanteth ſufficient founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his not foundamentals in his ſenſe, and is a not fundamental foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for diuers cauſes. Firſt, becaus the place is obſcure, and ſo vnfit to found anie infallible certaintie, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of this ſo weightie a point. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becaus it is not certaine, that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:43717:141"/> the Apoſtle by <hi>ſuperſtructions,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth doctrines, and not only works. Thirdly, becaus though he called ſome doctrins, <hi>ſuperſtructions,</hi> it is not certaine, that he meant doctrins of faith; or if he meant doctrins of faith, that he called them <hi>ſuperſtructions</hi> in reſpect of ſauing faith, Church or ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and not in reſpect only of other points of faith, on which they are built. And we denie not, but in reſpect of themſelues, ſome points of faith maie be termed fundamental, other not fundamental. Fourthly, becaus though we graunt, that Saint Paul called ſome points of faith, <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructions</hi> in reſpect of the Church, or of ſaluation, how proueth D. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he meant ſo, euen when they are ſufficiently propoſed? we denie not, but ſome points maie be termed <hi>ſuperſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> in reſpect of ſauing faith, Church or ſaluation, becaus they are not ſo abſolutly neceſſarie to ſauing faith, Church, or ſaluation, to be actually beleued, as ſome other points are. But this wil not proue, that
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:43717:142"/> they are not neceſſarie to ſauing faith Church, and ſaluation, to be actually beleued, if they be ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and neceſſarie virtually to be beleued, howfoeuer. 5. Admit, that he called them <hi>ſuperſtructions,</hi> euen when<note place="margin">Superſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may be eſſential.</note> they are ſufficiently propoſed, how proueth Do. Porter, that he meant, they were not then eſſential to ſauing faith, Church, or ſaluation? Is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that is laied vpon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſſential or neceſſarie to the building? And in this is the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, whether, anie articles, which maie be termed <hi>ſuperſtructions,</hi> be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to ſauing faith, Church, or ſaluation, or no? we ſee the walls and roof are ſuperſtructions to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and yet eſſential to the houſe. So on euerie hand falleth down Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Potters ground out of Scripture, for not fundamental points in the Proteſtants ſenſe; which is, that to haue ſauing faith, Church, and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">See 6. 2.</note> they need not be beleued actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though they be propoſed ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, not at al, virtually. For if he
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:43717:142"/> only would, that ſome points of faith<note place="margin">How ſome points of faith may be called not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</note> are ſo not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal to ſauing faith, Church, or ſaluation, as they need not be actually beleued, vnles they be ſufficiently propoſed, and are not abſolutly neceſſarie, as ſome others are, there would be no queſtion. But this kinde of not fundamentals, wil not help him, to iuſtifie his Churches, erring ſinfully in ſome points of faith ſufficiently propoſed, or his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with ſuch Churches.</p>
               <p>5. Other Proteſtants would proue, that<note place="margin">Perkins and others cited c. 7. n. 1.</note> true Churches maie err inſome points of faith ſufficiently propoſed, becaus the Galathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were turned to an other Ghoſpel, and the Corinthians denied the Reſurrection: and neuertheles Saint Paul calleth them Churches of God. But this argument, if it were good, would proue more then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants commonly do teach. For it would proue that true Churches maie err euen in fundamental points, which Proteſtants commonly denie. For doubtles, ſuch were the aforeſaied errors. Secondly, it is euident out of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:43717:143"/> Saint Paul himſelf. 1. Cor. 15. verſ. 12. That only ſome of the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Reſurrection. For his words are. <hi>Some among ye ſaie, there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead.</hi> And the ſame, Proteſtants confés of the Galathians. For thus Sadeel Reſp. ad Arthurum c. 5, <hi>There was a Church among the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians, which is denominated of the better parte</hi> Whitaker controuer. 2. q. 5. c. 18. <hi>Some of the Galathians fel from pure faith, not al.</hi> And. c. 19. <hi>The Galathians, that failed, were no Church.</hi> Morton l. 2. Apologi c. 39. <hi>Not al the Corinthians or Galathians, but verie few were drowned in thos errors.</hi> And as Saint Auguſtin ſaieth l. de Anima c. 17. and els where often: The holie Scripture vſeth ſignifie by a part, the whole, and by the whole, a part.</p>
               <p>6. Doctor Potter ſec. 7. cit. p. 79.<note place="margin">Catholiks calling the Creed the foundation, is not for D. Potters pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos.</note> 89. &amp; ſeqq. citeth diuers Fathers and Catholikes calling the Creed the foundation.

In other ſenſes, the Creed maie wel be called the foundation, ether becaus it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth al the moſt principal and moſt capital articles: or becaus al other points of faith depend on it: or becaus it muſt be actually beleued of al, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſufficeth it that it be only virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleued: Nether wil it follow, that the Creed alone is eſſential or ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to a Church, becaus it alone is the foundation therof, better then it wil follow, that the foundation alone is eſſential or ſufficient to a houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus<note place="margin">VVhat is alone the foundation, is not alone eſſential or neceſſarie.</note> it alone is the foundation. At moſt wil follow, that it is the cheif eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential parte of the Church, on which the reſt eſſential parts depend, becaus it alone is the foundation: which we willingly graunt. And vpon ſuch weak foundations as thes: depend D. Potters proofes, that the Creed alone is eſſential to the Church. And that
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:43717:144"/> who beleveth the Creed, hath ſauing faith, is in the true Church, and in true waie of ſaluation, though he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue not, or disbeleue other points of faith ſufficiently propoſed. Hence it<note place="margin">L. Cant. p. 29. Deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſome, but not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</note> appeareth alſo, why (as I ſaied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) they rather ſaie ſome articles alone, are fundamental or the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, then that ſome alone, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie; becaus ſome articles are in ſome ſenſe the only foundation of the Church and of ſaluation, but in no<note place="margin">Some arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles be the foundation, but not alone neceſſarie.</note> ſenſe are only neceſſarie. For al poins of faith are two waies neceſſarie. Firſt, abſolutly neceſſarie, to be virtually and implicitly beleued. Secondly, conditionally, to be beleued alſo actually, if they be ſufficiently propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Thus we haue ſeene, that Doctor Potter hath not ſo much as anie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ground, much les certaine and infallible (as he ought to haue for ſo weightie a matter) for the diſtinction of fundamental and not fundamental points in his ſenſe, ether in Scripture, Fathers, reaſon, or Catholiks doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin. Now let vs shew that though we
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:43717:144"/> granted him his diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his ſenſe, yet it would not, ſuffice to mainteine the Proteſtants Churches, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining wherof, it was deuiſed, as Rouſe confeſſed, ſup. c. 1. and is moſt certaine.</p>

Is there no communion peculiar to the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, which they haue among themſelues, and one to an other, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue to Infidels? If Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts had indeed true charitie ether toward God, or the vniuerſal Church, they would not ſeparate themſelues from her communion in Sacraments, and publik worship of God. For as S. Aug.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:43717:156"/> lib. 1. de Sermone Domini c. 3. <hi>If they had charitie, they would not teare in peeces the Bodie of Christ, which is the Church.</hi> But they doe external acts againſt charitie, and vainely pretend inward charitie. And it is contrarie to charitie both towards themſelues and others, to forſake the communion in Sacraments, and publik worship of God, of the vniuerſal Church. For ſo (as is before shewed) they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues<note place="margin">Proteſtant inference abſurd.</note> out of al Churches, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in none. And out of al that hath bene ſaied hitherto of faith and Communion, appeareath euidently how fondly Proteſtants infer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues or other Churches or perſons, whom they pleaſe, to be true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or true members of the Church, or in the way of ſaluation, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they beleue al the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points. For that is not enough to a true Church, or to a true member therof, or to the way of ſaluation. But they should add alſo, that they doe not ſinfully err in anieother point of faith, or in Communion. Becaus
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:43717:157"/> if they ſinfully err in anie point of faith, they are Heretiks: and if they ſinfully err in Communion, they are Schiſmatiks: and ſo no true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, nor true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the Church, nor in the way of ſaluation. But becaus Proteſtants deſpaire to proue, that ſuch Churches or perſons, as they mainteine, doe not err ſinfully at al in faith or communion, they ſpeak not of this: and damnably deceaue thos that beleue onely fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal points.

               <head>Proteſtants errors about communion, refuted outof vvhat vvas ſaied in the former Chapter. <hi>THIRTEENTH CHAPTER.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. OVt of that, which we have ſaied of Communion, are clearly refuted the errors of Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants touching the ſame: their firſt, and radical error, and the foundation of the reſt, is, that <note n="*" place="margin">King Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes reſp. ad Peron p. 384</note> Communion is not eſſential to a true Church, or to a true member of the Church. For Communion is put in the definitions of the Church taken out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and giuen by Fathers, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants themſelues: and therfore eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to a true Church, and to euerie true member of it: If anie aske, how then can a true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the Church, be without Communion, as if he be in a Deſert or be by force hindered
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:43717:158"/> from Communion? I anſwer, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or material things cannot be without natural or material exiſtence of euerie eſſential parte of them: But<note place="margin">Moral things may haue their partes but morally.</note> moral things (ſuch as a member of the Church is, depending of mans wil) maie be when ſome eſſential parte is only morally, and by effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wil. And ſo Communion of a man in a Deſert, or held by force, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally maie be. For it is in his wil to be done, when he can, and ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate: and neuer leaueth to be, til he haue a wil the contrarie, as Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiks have. And it is eſſential, and ſufficient to a true member of the Church, when he cannot actually communicate with the Church, to profés to haue this wil to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate whenſoeuer he can, and ought.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An other error of Proteſtans is, that to leave the external commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, is not to leave the Church: as one maie leave the cuſtome of the Colledg, yet not the Colledg: ſo Chillingworth,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:43717:158"/> c. 5. p. 265. 269. For Communion<note place="margin">To leaue an eſſential par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te, is to leaue the whole.</note> is eſſential to the Church, and to leaue an eſſential parte of a thing, is to leave the thing itſelf: wheras the cuſtome of a Colledg is accidental to a Colledg, and to leave the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of a thing, is not to leave the thing it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An other error is, which D. Potter hath ſec. 3. p. 74. <hi>that they forſake not the Communion of the Church of Rome, no more then the Bodie of Chriſt:</hi> For to refuſe to communicate with her in vſe of Sacraments, Liturgie, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blik worship, is to forſake her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And he that meanes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by <hi>Communion,</hi> ſpeaks a new lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as indeed à new doctrin, needs à new language, or equivocation to vphold it Wherfore Chillingworth c. 5. p. 261. ſaieth. <hi>It needs no proof, that Luther and his followers forſook the external communion of the Roman Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. An other error, which Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth hath c. 5. p. 270. is, that <hi>the whole Church being corrupted, ſome parts of it,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:43717:159"/> might, and did reforme themſelues, and yet might, and did continue parts of the Church, though ſeparated from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal communion of the other parts, which would not reforme.</hi> As a man maie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a vice of a ſocietie, and yet be ſtil of the Societie. And p. 271. <hi>It is certainly falſe, that no twoe men or Churches, deuided in external commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, can be both true parts of the Cath. Church.</hi> This I ſaie is eaſily refuted. For to omit, that blaſphemie (that the whole Church can be corrupted) whoſoever volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarily ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from the external co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the whole Church, ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from an eſſential part of her.<note place="margin">Roote of the Proteſtants errors.</note> For external communion is as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the viſible Church, as is profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith. And al thes errors riſe, of not conſidering or remembring wel, the former definitions of the true Church, giuen by Scripture, Fathers, and themſelues, and confirmed by reaſon. In al which, <hi>Communion,</hi> is put as an eſse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tial part of that true Church, which Scripture, Fathers, Reaſon, and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:43717:159"/> (ſomtimes) alſo Proteſtans, propoſe<note place="margin">Proteſtants forſake the external communion of the viſible Church.</note> vnto vs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And herevpon it is evident, that Chillingworth in confeſſing c. 5. cit. p. 273. <hi>That as for the external commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the viſible Church, we haue without ſcrupule formerly granted, that Proteſtants did forſake it.</hi> And p. 274. <hi>Though Luther forſooke the external com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Cath. Church, it wil not follow, he was a Sciſmatike:</hi> Plainely confeſſeth, that Luther and Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are true Sciſmatiks, and by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the external communion of the <note n="*" place="margin">Chilling. p 263. The viſible Ch. ſignifieth the whole Church.</note> whole viſible or Catholik Church, ether made a new viſible Church, or are in no viſible Church at al: For the external communion of the whole viſible Church, was an eſſential parte of her, as wel as profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith: And none can leaue an eſſential parte of the whole viſible Church, but he muſt leaue the<note place="margin">VVho is out of the whole viſible Ch. is in none.</note> whole viſible Church, which is to make a formal ſchiſme For he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not leaue the whole viſible Church, but he muſt be in no viſible Church,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:43717:160"/> ſeing the whole viſible Church, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth al viſible Churches; or he muſt be in a new ſubſtantial vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, which muſt be, of his<note place="margin">VVhy no iuſt cauſe, to goe out of the whole viſible Church.</note> owne making. And hence it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, why there can be no iuſt cauſe to leaue the communion of the whole viſible Church, becaus there can be no iuſt cauſe to put onesſelf out of al viſible Churches, and to be in no viſible Church at al. There maie be iuſt cauſe of ſeparation from the communion of ſome particular Church, becaus she maie inuincibly err in ſome points of faith, and exact profeſſion of her<note place="margin">VVhy may be iuſt cauſe, to goe out of a particular Church.</note> errors, for a condition of her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And nether is it neceſſarie to ſaluation, or to a member of the true Church, to be in communion of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie particular Church; nor the going out of anie particular Church (if there be iuſt cauſe for it) is the going out of the whole true Church: But the whole true Church, is not fallible, vincibly or inuincibly, in anie point of faith, by reaſon of Chriſts promiſe, and the holie Ghoſtsaſſiſtance. So that, for
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:43717:160"/> pretence of errors, there can be no iuſt cauſe to go out of her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion. And the going out of her, is the going out of al Churches whatſoeuer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus<note place="margin">L. Canterb. p. 311. out of the Cath.

And becaus there can be no iuſt cauſe to goe out of the whole Church (for then we should be in none at al) it muſt needs be, that she is infallible in matters of faith.</p>

For if they knew, what true ſauing faith is, They would neuer ſaie, The eſſence of it conſiſteth only in beleif of ſome principal points; or the vnitie of it, in vnitie only of ſuch points: or if they knew, what a true Church is, they would neuer ſaie, that ſome principal points only, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the eſſence of it, or that the ſubſtantial vnitie of the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth onely in vnitie of ſuch points: nor would they compare integritie in faith or in communion, to health, and defect in faith or in communion, to diſeaſes or vice: nor ſaie, that they

For al thes errors, and the like, riſe of their not knowing or not marking, what is true ſauing faith, what is a true Chriſtian Church, what is true Chriſtian Communion, as is euident by what hath been ſaied and proued: If they would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly agree with vs, in the definitions of ſauing faith, true Church, and her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, giuen by the Scripture, Fathers, and by themſelues ſometimes, and confirmed by reaſon, thes errors of theirs, about fundamental and Not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal points, about the eſſence, and vnitie of true ſauing faith, and about the true Chriſtian Church, and her communion, would preſently vanish. And if they wil mainteine thes errors, they muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the definitions of true ſauing faith, true Church, and her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:43717:167"/> giuen by Scripture, Fathers, and<note place="margin">Proteſtants muſt make new defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſo change the queſtion.</note> themſelues ſometimes, and giue new definitions, and confés, that they diſpute not with vs of ſuch a faith, Church, or communion, as Scripture, Fathers, and themſelues ſometimes, propoſe: but of an other faith, Church, and communion, of which nether Scripture, nor Fathers euer dreamed, deſcribed, or propoſed to vs; but is inuented by themſelues. And if they wil confés this, I wil not diſpute with them, whether there be anie fundamental or Not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal articles to ſuch a faith, or Church, or whether in ward charitie wil ſuffice to ſuch a communion, as they haue deuiſed, different from the faith, Church, and communion deſcribed by Scripture, and Fathers, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſometimes.

But ſuch faith, ſuch Church, ſuch communion, is perfectly and entirely one (at leaſt virtually and implicitly) in al points of faith, in al vſe of Sacraments, and al publik worship of God: and can only differ in ſome rites or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; which being accidental, and therfore by none put into the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, (as profeſſion of faith and communion) cannot deuide ſubſtance of the Church.

And who careful of his ſaluation, wil not prefer a Church, which is entirely one in al points of faith, and communion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Church, which confeſſedly is deuided both in ſome points of faith, and altogether in communion? If one ask, why can not the Church admit diuiſion in faith or communion, as wel as in other matters: I anſwer,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:43717:168"/> becaus Faith and Communion are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential partes of the Church, and, as ſuch, put in her definition: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can admit diuiſion in its eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial partes.

               <p n="11">11. It is charitie to admonish them, that they are in a damnable ſtate, who<note place="margin">Becaus they err damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
